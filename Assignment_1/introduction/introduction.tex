\section{Motivation and Objectives}

It has long been a complaint that while the university does provide free internet access to students, it is not of an appropriate quality, speed and has a limited bandwidth in comparison with the students' needs.
The purpose of this study is to:
 \begin{itemize}
     \item Collect data on the general opinion about the network
     \item Provide concrete benchmarks on the signal booster positions and quality of the network
     \item Make recommendations that will guide future placement of these devices within the hall
     \item There have been constant complaints from students that abide on rooms whose windows face outside the hall of unstable and weak network signals
 \end{itemize}



\section{Statement of Originality}

There has not been any previous research in this area and at this scale across the campus or in University Hall. Previous sentiments about the network have been expressed both through the respective students' representatives and freely on social media.
