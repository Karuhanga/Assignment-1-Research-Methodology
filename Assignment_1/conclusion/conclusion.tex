\section{Summary of Thesis Recommendations}

I therefore propose the following changes.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Installation of 360\textsuperscript{0} boosters to replace the current 180\textsuperscript{0} range boosters
    \item Installation of the said boosters on poles rather than on the sides of buildings which would prevent signal obstruction by the buildings
\end{itemize}


\section{Future Work}

Future research and improvements will focus on drawing more people into the interviewee pool and attempt to expand it to other halls of residence.
